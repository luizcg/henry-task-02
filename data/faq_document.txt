Q167: Why did the company's effective tax rate decrease from 2022 to 2023?

Q192: What factors can materially and adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price?

A192: Factors include global and regional economic conditions, adverse macroeconomic conditions, changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic aspects. Additionally, political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents, and other business interruptions can also have a material adverse effect.

Context: Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other

Q193: How can restrictive measures on international trade impact the Company?

A193: Restrictive measures on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, can adversely impact the Company's operations and supply chain. This can limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers and may require the Company to change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and cease offering certain third-party applications. Implementing these changes can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to operations.

Context: Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments could be more severe and restrictive, materially adversely affecting the Company’s business.

Context: For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business.

Q196: What factors contribute to the Company facing substantial competition in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, and tablets?

A196: The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies with significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships, broader product lines, lower-priced products, and larger installed base of active devices. Additionally, competition has intensified as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.

Context: The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.

Q197: Why is the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage potentially at risk?

A197: The Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage is at risk because many of its competitors seek to compete through aggressive pricing, very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates.

Context: Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.

Q198: What risks can defects in components and products purchased from third parties create for the Company?

A198: Defects in components and products purchased from third parties can make the Company's products unsafe, creating a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. The Company could also face product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, inventory write-offs, significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines.

Context: Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.

Q199: What measures does the Company take to address the risk associated with excess or obsolete inventory?

A199: The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. It also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components, and reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable.

Context: The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.

Q362: What caused the decrease in the 2022 gross margin compared to 2021?

A362: The decrease in the 2022 gross margin compared to 2021 was primarily due to a provision against hardware inventory, a decrease in product margin, increased costs related to product departments and distribution centers as a percentage of net revenue, and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

Context: During 2022, we updated our lululemon Studio strategy to focus on digital app-based services, which meant we no longer expected to be able to sell all of the in-home hardware inventory above cost. We recognized a provision of $62.9 million against hardware inventory during 2022. This reduced 2022 gross margin by 80 basis points. The remaining 150 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of: •a decrease in product margin of 100 basis points primarily due to higher markdowns, sales mix, and increased damages and shrink, partially offset by lower air freight costs;  •an increase in costs related to our product departments and distribution centers as a percentage of net revenue of 60 basis points; and  •an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 40 basis points.

Q437: How did Procter & Gamble manage the fluctuations in costs, particularly related to commodities and input materials?

A437: Procter & Gamble managed cost fluctuations through pricing actions to offset inflationary impacts and consistent productivity improvements across their operations.

Context: Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters, labor or freight constraints have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.

Q581: How does the company classify its short-term investments?

A581: The company classifies its short-term investments based on their maturities and liquidity. Investments with maturities of three months to five years are generally considered short-term, especially if they are highly liquid and represent the investment of cash available for current operations. Investments that may have maturities beyond five years can also be classified as short-term if they're considered highly liquid and are intended for current operations.

Context: Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income.

U.S. merchandise inventories are valued by the cost method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. Canadian and Other International merchandise inventories are predominantly valued using the cost and retail inventory methods, respectively, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

Q583: What determines the fair value of available-for-sale short-term investments?

A583: The fair value of available-for-sale short-term investments is determined primarily by changes in interest rates and market liquidity.

Context: Short-Term Investments Short-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. Government and Agency Notes), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five  years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value using the specific identification method with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis and are recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. These available-for-sale investments have low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S. Government and Agencies.

The carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company’s interest in the investee’s net income or loss and any impairments and is classified in other assets, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets.  Equity investments for which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and for which fair value is not readily determinable are accounted for using the measurement alternative. Such investments are carried at cost, less any impairments, and are adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee.

Q1473: How does the company determine the grant-date fair value of RSUs and stock options?

A1473: The grant-date fair and fair stock-based compensation expenses are typically valued at the fair value of the company's common stock on the grant date for RSUs, whereas the Black-Scholes option pricing model is used for stock options, which requires inputs like expected term, volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividend yield.

Q2875: How does a company account for potential liabilities from legal proceedings in its financial statements?

A2875: A company records a liability for potential legal proceedings when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimatable. The company also regularly reviews the materiality and likelihood of potential loss contingencies to determine the need for adjusting recorded liabilities or providing additional disclosures in the financial statements.

Context: We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingplements where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.

Q3387: Why are some device sales revenue at AT&T not immediately recognized upon the device sale?

A3387: Some device sales revenue at AT&T is not immediately recognized upon the sale because these sales often include promotional discounts that are earned by customers over the contract term, which necessitates deferring and amortizing the revenue over the contract duration. Another reason is when sales involve installment payment options, where the complete revenue is recognized upfront at the sale point, but the cash receipt is deferred until the installment payments are made, necessitating the recording of a contract asset that is then amortized.

Context: AT&T recognizes revenue from device sales with promotions or installment payments differently. For promotional discounts, revenue is deferred and amortized over the contract term. Meanwhile, installment sales involve recognizing revenue upfront but deferring the cash receipt until payments are made, resulting in a recorded contract asset to be amortized over time.

Q3835: How are unpaid losses and loss expenses calculated in the financial statements of an insurance and reinsurance company?

A3835: Unpaid losses and loss expenses are calculated based on estimated unpaid portions of liabilities for losses under insurance policies and agreements, considering reported but unpaid claims (case reserves), and claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). This process involves significant judgment and estimation, and the reserves are not discounted for time value of money except for structured settlements and certain claims where timing and amount are predictable.

Context: As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements. These reserves include provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid (case reserves), and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). The loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money except for structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims.

Q3836: What are the key factors that contribute to the uncertainty in establishing loss reserves for property and casualty insurance claims?

A3836: The key factors contributing to uncertainty in loss reserve estimates for property and casualty insurance include long-tail risk characteristics, the need for informed judgments based on current circumstances, the use of historical loss data and actuarial methods, and external factors like inflation and legal changes. These uncertainties are exacerbated by events such as heightened inflation and potential impacts from climate change.

Context: The process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured losses known at the date of accrual. For example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events, or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. The effects of recent heightened inflation create additional uncertainty, while climate change could, over time, add new uncertainties to the loss reserving process.

Q3838: How does the reserving method for Global Reinsurance differ due to its use of reports from ceding companies?

A3838: The reserving method for Global Reinsurance is partly based on claims information reported by ceding companies, making it subject to unique risks such as reporting inaccuracies and delays, limited historical data for some reinsurance contracts, and variability in the number of claims.

Context: For our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. Because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. This results in unique risks and uncertainties including reporting inaccuracies, delays, and variability in the number of claims.

A4044: State and federal regulations impact the Company's ability to set premium rates by imposing review processes for rate reasonableness, requiring public disclosure for certain rate increases, and applying strict criteria for premium rate modifications.

Q4574: What criteria does the company use to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized on acquisition-related intangible assets?

Q5766: How does the use of a full yield curve approach in estimating pension costs affect the measurement of liabilities and expenses?

This approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates along the yield curve. This approach does not affect the measurement of our pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities but generally results in lower benefit expense in periods when the yield curve is upward sloping.

Q5769: What approach is used to test goodwill for impairment at The Hershey Company?

A5769: The Hershey Company conducts annual impairment tests for goodwill either through a qualitative assessment evaluating economic, industry, and company-specific factors, or through a quantitative approach that compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment is recognized.

Context: Our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter. We test goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors in assessing the fair value of the related reporting unit. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is indicated, requiring recognition of a goodwill impairment charge for the differential (up to the carrying value of goodwill).

Q6146: How does the benefit design of Medicare Part D impact the quarterly insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows?

A6146: The Medicare Part D benefit design impacts quarterly insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows by varying coverage as a member’s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period. This leads to a sharing of a greater portion of prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages of the plan year, affecting the quarterly benefit ratio pattern.

Context: Our quarterly Insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit Grant program, the changing membership composition, and the multistage plan period starting annually on January 1. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages.
